## Project Objective

- We’ll build a novel and creative todo list app that implements the [Eisenhower’s Urgent/Important Principle.](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm#:~:text=The%20urgent%20are%20not%20important,effective%20as%20well%20as%20efficient.)
- It divides all todo items to 4 categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, not urgent and not important
- Traditional todo lists don’t emphasize the “important but not urgent” items, causing users either forget these items or add all of them together and feel overwhelmed. Our todo list will avoid such problems.
- Allow users to add optional comment to each item, helping users to specify their needs with more comprehensive description.
